# sentence-transformers
# transformers
#torch==2.7.0+cpu             # Consider torch-cpu if GPU isn't used in the container
#Pillow            # For image handling often required by ML/PDF libs

# Langchain
# langchain>=0.3.0,<0.4.0 # Pin major Langchain version range if desired
# langchain-core
# langchain-community # Keep if using community integrations like ChatOllama wrapper etc.

# # Vector Database Client

# --- Important Notes ---
# 1. Your local package ('pdfdocintel') MUST be installed from its .whl file
#    within the Dockerfile (e.g., COPY wheels/*.whl /tmp/ && pip install /tmp/*.whl).
#    It should NOT be listed here.
#
# 2. Transitive dependencies (like pydantic, starlette, numpy, httpx, PyYAML, etc.)
#    will be installed automatically by pip based on the direct dependencies above.
#    Do NOT list them unless absolutely necessary to pin a specific sub-dependency version.
#
# 3. Add your specific spaCy model download URL above (like en_core_web_sm).
#    Find the correct URL/sha256 on the spaCy Models release page.
#
# 4. Review if torch-cpu is sufficient to potentially reduce image size.
